This is my personal portfolio website, where you can explore the projects 
I've worked on, my skills, education, and interests. 
I built this website using HTML, CSS, and media queries to make it responsive for mobile devices.
My goal is to showcase my work and skills to potential employers and collaborators.

The website has been deployed using Vercel, and you can view it live at the link below: laeticia-portfolio.vercel.app
