        <h1>Library Management System</h1>

        <p>The Library Management System was a project given in school in the Analysis and Design course by our lecturer, Dr. Patrick. 
        We were asked to create a system that would enable librarians to manage their library.</p>

        <p>The group number was Group 11, made up of 7 members.</p>

        <p>In this project, my group members and I were able to come up with the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Functional requirements</li>
            <li>Non-functional requirements</li>
            <li>UI/UX design</li>
            <li>Class diagram</li>
            <li>Use case diagram</li>
            <li>Activity diagram</li>
            <li>Sequence diagram</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The software development life cycle we used to implement this library system was the Incremental Model because various information was known before the implementation.</p>

        <p>At the end, we were asked to submit a report and a PowerPoint presentation of our Library Management System, which is displayed below:</p>
